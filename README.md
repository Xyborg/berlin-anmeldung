# Berlin Anmeldung Appointments (Python)
This Python script will automatically check for free Anmeldung appointments in Berlin, and find them for you.

The way I created it, it will list free appointments for all the districts, as most of the time is hard to find a free slot. It's up to you then to decide if the BÃ¼rgeramt (citizens' office) is too far for you or not.

If you need more information regarding how the Anmeldung works, check the following page:
